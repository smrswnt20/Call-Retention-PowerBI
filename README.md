To enhance our understanding of customer loyalty and improve retention, I developed a PowerBI dashboard that analyzes customer behavior based on their service usage. The dashboard offers insights into how different services are utilized, highlighting trends in retention rates and identifying key factors that influence both customer loyalty and churn. By examining retention patterns across various customer segments and exploring the relationship between service usage and overall retention, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior.

This data-driven analysis will guide our strategies to improve customer satisfaction, tailor service offerings, and implement targeted initiatives to strengthen customer retention, ultimately fostering a more loyal customer base and driving sustained business growth.
